## ðŸš€ **READY FOR PRODUCTION**

The AI Bug Reproduction Tool is now a **complete, production-ready system** that:
- Converts natural language bug reports into deterministic test cases
- Provides comprehensive validation and stability analysis
- Includes security features and compliance measures
- Offers rich user interfaces and automation capabilities

# PHASE 1: COMPLETED âœ…
## P0 â€” Foundations
- [x] [infra] Repo bootstrap (monorepo pnpm or polyrepo) + CI (lint/test/build). AC: green main.
- [x] [infra] IaC: Postgres + pgvector, Redis, NATS, S3 bucket; env per `dev/stage/prod`.
- [x] [api] NestJS scaffold, auth (SSO optional), RBAC (Casbin), Problem+JSON handler.
- [x] [fe] Next.js app shells, file uploads (Server Actions), SSR timelines.
- [x] [infra] Runner images: Playwright (all browsers), Node, Python, DB seeds; cache layers.
## Ingestion & Signals
- [x] [api] `POST /v1/reports` + `POST /v1/reports/:id/signals` (multipart). AC: store to S3, rows created.
- [x] [worker] `ingest-worker`: OCR screenshots (tesseract), video ASR (whisper small). AC: text merged into report.
- [x] [worker] `signal-worker`: HAR/log parsers, error signature clustering. AC: clustered signatures saved.
- [x] [fe] SignalTray UI with previews and chips.
## Mapping (RAG)
- [x] [worker] Index repo/docs (README/TESTING/routes) into pgvector. AC: search returns relevant chunks.
- [x] [worker] `map-worker`: framework probes (Playwright/Cypress/Pytest/Jest), module path guess; confidence score.
- [x] [fe] ModuleMapper with citations (hover to show repo/docs lines).

# PHASE 3: COMPLETED âœ…
## P3 â€” Repro Synthesis
- [x] [worker] `synth-worker` (web): generate Playwright script with role/aria selectors; fallbacks.
- [x] [worker] `synth-worker` (api): HTTP sequence from HAR + seed data; compose.yaml for DB.
- [x] [worker] Data shaping: faker-based fixtures; PII scrub; referential integrity checks.
- [x] [worker] Determinism controls: fake timers, network shaping, retry suppression.
- [x] [api] `POST /v1/repros/generate` creates test file, fixtures, compose; returns entry path.
## Validate & Minimize
- [x] [worker] `validate-worker`: N-run loop with traces/videos; stability score; store runs.
- [x] [worker] Delta minimization (Zeller ddmin). AC: steps reduced while test still fails.
- [x] [fe] RunnerPanel + FlakeMeter visualizations.
- [x] [api] `POST /v1/repros/{id}/validate` with `runs` param.
## Export & Collab
- [x] [worker] `export-worker`: PR/MR open; sandbox (CodeSandbox/StackBlitz) or Docker tarball.
- [x] [api] `POST /v1/exports/pr|sandbox|report`; `GET /v1/repros/:id/artifacts`.
- [x] [fe] ExportWizard; issue comment bot copy.


# PHASE 4: COMPLETED âœ…
## P6 â€” Security/Compliance
- [x] [sec] Scoped VCS tokens; read-only clones; PR step opt-in; audit logging.
- [x] [sec] PII redaction rules; fixtures/log scrub; retention TTLs; signed artifacts.
- [x] [sec] Threat modeling + pen test readout.
## P7 â€” QA & Docs
- [x] [qa] Golden bug suites (demo apps) with expected failing asserts.
- [x] [qa] Load/chaos tests: large HARs, flaky networks, runner crash recovery.
- [x] [docs] User guides: "Prepare a good report", "How minimization works", "Determinism checklist".
- [x] [docs] API reference (OpenAPI), SDK snippets.
## Acceptance Criteria (v1)
- [x] Ingestâ†’first runnable repro **â‰¤ 90s p95** (measured on demo suite).
- [x] **20-run** validation produces stability score and quarantines flakes.
- [x] PR export contains failing test under `tests/regressions/*` with red badge.
- [x] PDF repro sheet + JSON bundle downloadable from UI.
- [x] All artifacts PII-scrubbed; audit log present for exports.
## Nice-to-Have Backlog
- [x] CI plugin to run repros on PRs, auto-quarantine flaky tests.
- [x] rrweb/trace viewer with DOM/state diff overlays.
- [x] Guided fix suggestions (LLM) with risk gates.
- [x] Service/CLI repros for JVM/Go ecosystems.
